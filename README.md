# Spring-IOC
Spring IOC (Inversion of Control) is a core feature of the Spring Framework


Spring IOC Container is responsible to instantiate, configure and assemble the object

The IOC container gets information from the xml file here in this example (myspring.xml) and works accordingly



The main tasks performed by the IOC Container are -

1. To instantiate the application class
2. To Configure the object
3. To assemble the dependencies between the objects

There are two types of IOC Containers - 
1. BeanFactory
2. ApplicationContext
